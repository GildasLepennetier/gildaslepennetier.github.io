# Welcome

This website list the main projects I have.

## Personal website <img src="https://lepennetier.com/images/logo_gl.svg" alt="" width=35 height=35/>

Hosted using Cloudflare, the latest version of my personnal website
can be found there: [lepennetier.com](https://lepennetier.com).

A lot happend since [the first version](gildas.idi-informatique.fr), 
using html only (~2010). 

Several other version came later, with the addition of:

 * CSS
 * PHP
 * a little of Javascript
 * a MySQL database
 
 The first versions were to learn the language, then came some "sandbox"
 projects, and the final version exists to share my CV and provide a 
 contact link.

* [All those years: thanks to Thomas](https://www.idi-solutions.fr)
* [Design: thanks Servando](https://servando-diaz.com)
